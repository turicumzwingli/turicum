### [Serena Strecker](https://history.yale.edu/people/serena-strecker) | Digital Editor

Serena Strecker is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of History at Yale University specializing in early modern media and religious culture with an emphasis on digital humanities. Her article ["Confessional Cross-Pollination: Basel Humanists as Suppliers of Lutheran and Catholic *Exempla*"](https://doi.org/10.3390/rel15101247) in *Religions* showcases the vital role of Swiss humanists in cross-confessional networks of information exchange and religious discourse in early modern Europe by using the text analysis and concordance software AntConc. Her article "Unlocking the Digitized Archive of Early Modern Print: The Automated Transcription of Sixteenth-Century Printed Books," forthcoming in the [*Sixteenth Century Journal*](https://www.sixteenthcentury.org/journal) discusses issues of labor ethics in the use of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) software and proposes a practical, ethical workflow for transcribing early modern print with HTR. Her dissertation examines early modern Lutheran and Catholic *exempla* collections using digital humanities methods, including HTR transcription, AntConc, and network analysis.
