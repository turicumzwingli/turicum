<p>
  This site presents a growing collection of newly commissioned translations alongside thoroughly revised versions of earlier English renderings, each carefully checked against the original Latin and German texts. The hope is to present Zwingli in readable translations. Designed for both teaching and broader public engagement, these translations aim to make the writings of the Reformation more accessible to a contemporary audience. Additional texts will be added in the coming months and years as the project continues to expand.
